Simple robust script to convert a collection of images into a pdf.
Supports drag + drop, files stored somewhere else and zip files or directories with nested structures.

Seriously, its quite robust, give it a .fpx and a .jfif file in a tar.gz file that is together with DLLs inside a zip file and it will still work.

## Installation:

Install python and pip, install PIL using pip.
